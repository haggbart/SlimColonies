**Colonists do their work, you do yours**

SlimColonies is a fork of [MineColonies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecolonies) where colonists take care of themselves. Build your colony, assign workers, and
everyone gets back to what they're doing.

## Philosophy

MineColonies and SlimColonies serve different purposes. MineColonies offers deep colony simulation when that's what you're looking for. SlimColonies is for when you want to work
alongside your colonists without managing them.

This matters most in complex modpacks. When you're already deep in GregTech or juggling multiple demanding mods, SlimColonies lets everyone focus on their own work. It feels more
vanilla and fits naturally alongside other content. Colonists do their thing, you do yours, and you help each other grow the colony together.

## Why SlimColonies?

**Set it and forget it**: Efficient behaviors are default. No research to unlock basic functionality, no separate progression systems to manage.

**Modpack friendly**: Works alongside complex mods without competing for your attention. No happiness tracking, disease management, or raid events.

**Automation first**: Visitor recruitment is free, couriers work efficiently from day one, and workers don't need hand-holding.

## Development Status

Active development with tens of thousands of lines already removed.

## What's Different
