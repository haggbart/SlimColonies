# SlimColonies

**Self-sufficient colonies that actually help you**

SlimColonies is a fork of [MineColonies](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies) where colonists take care of themselves. Build your colony, assign workers, and get back to
playing Minecraft while they handle the rest. No
babysitting, no events, no demands - just helpful NPCs that enhance your world.

## Philosophy

For players who want the automation and assistance of colonies without the city management gameplay. While MineColonies offers deep colony simulation for those who enjoy that
complexity, here your colonists are self-sufficient helpers who work alongside you without requiring active management.

## What Makes Colonies "Demanding"?

Many features in the original MineColonies require constant player intervention or force unnecessary complexity:

- **Research-Gated Basic Functionality**: Simple quality-of-life features like efficient ordering (25% threshold) were locked behind research, causing couriers to spam small orders
  and waste time instead of working properly by default.

- **Arbitrary Management Systems**: Happiness, diseases, and raids created busywork that pulled players away from actually building and exploring to babysit their colonists.

- **Overcomplicated Progression**: Basic worker efficiency was tied to research requirements and item costs, making colonies feel like a chore to maintain rather than helpful
  automation.

SlimColonies removes these pain points and makes sensible behaviors the default, so your colonists work intelligently from day one without requiring a PhD in colony management.

## For Developers

### IntelliJ Setup

1. Install [Java JDK 17](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/haggbart/SlimColonies.git`
3. Open the project folder in IntelliJ (right-click `build.gradle` â†’ `Open Folder as IntelliJ Project`)
4. When prompted, select `Auto Import` and ensure a valid Gradle and JVM are selected
5. Refresh Gradle (click the refresh icon in the Gradle tool window)

If Gradle synchronization fails:
- Check `File â†’ Project Structure â†’ Project â†’ Project SDK` is set to JDK 17
- Check `File â†’ Settings â†’ Build, Execution, Deployment â†’ Build Tools â†’ Gradle â†’ Gradle JVM` is set to JDK 17

### Development Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Build the project: `./gradlew build`
3. Regenerate data files (if needed): `./gradlew runData`
4. Test in-game: `./gradlew runClient`

### Troubleshooting

- If Gradle tasks fail due to memory issues, adjust settings in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
- If libraries can't be resolved after branch changes, refresh Gradle again
