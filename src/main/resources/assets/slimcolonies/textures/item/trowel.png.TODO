TODO: Create 16x16 pixel art texture for trowel
- Should look like a mason's trowel (flat triangular blade with handle)
- Simple design, similar style to vanilla Minecraft tools
- Use iron/gray colors for blade, brown for wooden handle
- For now, we could use a vanilla item texture as placeholder (stick, iron ingot, etc.)
