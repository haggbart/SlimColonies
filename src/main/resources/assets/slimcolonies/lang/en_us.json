    "slimcolonies.quests.tutorial.warehouse.obj4": "Neat! The food your farmer produces will now automatically reach the restaurant through the warehouse. Here, have a set of tools you can drop off in the warehouse to be delivered to your citizens on demand.",

    "slimcolonies.quests.tutorial.welcome.obj2": "Welcome back! Were you able to navigate the Build Tool?",
    "slimcolonies.quests.tutorial.welcome.obj2.answer0": "Yes; mission accomplished!",
    "slimcolonies.quests.tutorial.welcome.obj2.answer0.reply": "Awesome! Then, before placing it, we first have to craft a Builder's Hut hut block.

    "slimcolonies.quests.tutorial.welcome.obj3.answer0": "No, I forgot the recipe!",
    "slimcolonies.quests.tutorial.welcome.obj3.answer0.reply": "A great leap forward often requires taking two steps back! Just surround a door with planks in the crafting table and put the Build Tool in the top slot.",
